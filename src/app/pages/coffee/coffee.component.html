<h2>History of Coffee</h2>
<p>
  Coffee has a fascinating origin tracing back to 9th-century Ethiopia. From there, it made its way through the Arabian Peninsula and into Europe, evolving into the global ritual it is today. Whether itâ€™s brewed in a cezve, a moka pot, or a state-of-the-art machine, every cup connects us to centuries of culture and craft.
